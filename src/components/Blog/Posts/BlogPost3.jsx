            <h3>1. Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>
              The optimal visiting season depends on your preferred activities. Summer months offer the warmest weather
              and longest daylight hours, perfect for hiking and camping. However, shoulder seasons provide fewer crowds
              and unique photographic opportunities with changing foliage or snow-capped peaks.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Summer (June-August): Warmest weather, all trails accessible</li>
              <li>Fall (September-November): Stunning autumn colors, cooler temperatures</li>
              <li>Winter (December-February): Snow activities, dramatic ice formations</li>
              <li>Spring (March-May): Wildflowers, waterfalls at peak flow</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Getting There</h3>
            <p>
              Access to the lake requires a moderate hike through well-maintained trails. The journey itself is part of
              the experience, offering glimpses of local wildlife and gradually revealing the lake's magnificence as you
              approach.
            </p>
            <h3>3. What to Bring</h3>
            <p>
              Proper preparation ensures both safety and enjoyment. Essential items include weather-appropriate
              clothing, plenty of water, navigation tools, and a camera to capture the unforgettable scenery. Remember
              to follow Leave No Trace principles to preserve this natural treasure for future generations.
